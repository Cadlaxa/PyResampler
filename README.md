# PyResampler
Python GUI toolkit for passing down Resampler arguments (single and batch resampling)

---
## To do:
- [ ] UI improvements
- [ ] Control output speed
- [ ] Use wine for resamplers (for mac and linux)
- [ ] Switch to pure python based FFpmeg and FFprobe (so mac and linux can use them too)
- [ ] Use custom fonts
- [x] Multi-threaded resampling
- [x] Generate frq files with Harvest
- [x] Accept any type of audio files
- [ ] Convert to wav (temp file) before sending it to the resampler
- [x] fader2.exe support
---
## How to use:
- Install necessary modules in order for the GUI script to run.
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
- The GUI will save the resampler and output directory in the config.yaml file.
