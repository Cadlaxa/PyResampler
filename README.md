## To do:
- [ ] UI improvements
- [ ] Control output speed
- [ ] Use wine for resamplers
- [ ] Switch to pure python based FFpmeg and FFprobe (so mac and linux can use them too)

## How to use:
Install necesarry modules in order for the GUI script to run.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

The GUI will save the resampler and output directory in the config.yaml file.
